# Reactivity Pack
I found Baldur's Gate 3's class and race reactions delightful. Yes, they are often only cosmetic, resulting in the line being phrased differently but having the same outcome. Yet these differences made each playthrough feel oddly distinct. Reactivity Pack is my attempt to add the same, on a much smaller scale, for BG1EE & BG2EE. 

## FAQ

### Q: Is this mod a compatibility nightmare?

A: I honestly don't know. I hope not. I'm not deleting any vanilla dialogue, even during instances where it would make sense, only appending new lines that CHARNAME could choose (if they meet the requirements). 

## CHANGELOG

#### 20241031 - Nightly. 

* (BG2EE) Added option for druids and rangers to recognize Guril Berries and offer alternatives for Rose to consider.

#### 20241107 - Nightly

* (BGEE) Mage CHARNAME can call Tranzig out.

* (BGEE) Blackguard, Berserker, Barbarian or Half-Orc CHARNAME can intimidate Karlat.

* (BGEE) Bard CHARNAME can ask to perform at the Friendly Arm Inn (need to expand to other inns & BG2EE).

* (BGEE) [4th wall] Elf & Half-Elf CHARNAME can ask Winthrop about his clean inn comment.

#### 20241108 - Nightly

* (BGEE) Wizard Slayers, Blackguards and Paladins can interject during Edwin's recruitment.

* (BGEE) Blackguards may choose to be edgelords with Dorn.

#### 20241109 - Nightly

* (BGEE) Druids & Rangers have unique lines when recruiting Faldorn.

* (BGEE) Druids, Rangers & Elves have unique lines during the Dryad of Cloak Peaks & Caldo interactions.

* (BGEE) Thief CHARNAMEs have the option of calling Safana out during her recruitment scheme.

* (BGEE) Paladins can persuade the Flaming Fist Mercenaries that they aren't bandits. Halflings can trick them. Half-Orcs, Berserkers, Blackguards and Barbarians can threaten them (with the appropriate loss of one reputation point).

* (BGEE) Paladins can try to set Bardolan at ease (and fail, but hey, at least you tried).

* (BGEE) Dark Moon Monks have unique lines about Viconia joining.

* (BGEE) Dark Moon Monks can kill Rasaad - missing out on his quest and losing two reputation points in the process. Your choice. I might expand this to allow Rasaad to join, indicating this is trickery, and have CHARNAME betray later (near the other Dark Soul Monks) instead. [Version 2.0 or later.]

* (BGEE) Sun Soul Monks can recognize what Rasaad is - and avoid his explanations. [Version 2.0] will have further reactivity through his RASAADJ dialogue (and quests).

* (BGEE) Thieves can earn a discount with Black Lily in exchange for information. [Version 2.0] might expand this further by improving the discount if CHARNAME offers actual information. E.g. info on the Iron Throne's activities. For now it's the most basic implemented form imaginable. Say you'll offer information, she gives you a discount, nothing further happens.

* (BGEE) IF CHARNAME isn't a mage, but another member of the party is, they can still challenge Tranzig to a magic duel. 

### 20241229 - Nightly 

* (BG2EE) Shamans can offer to help Wellyn's parents via dialogue.

* (BG2EE) Clerics of Lathander can have a bonding moment with Amaunator. Because he seems a *little* familiar.

* (BG2EE) Clerics or Paladins can sense a touch of divinity around Amaunator at the start of the dialogue. 

## FUTURE PLANS

* (BG2EE) Add option, if the player has more than X amount of gold, to comment as such in the Mithrest Inn. The nobles will still look down on you but, hey, at least you're rich!

* (Multiple) Add suggestions from https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/38824-class-race-reactivity-pack/

## LICENSING

* This mod is open source. That means anyone is free to fork, make pull requests or alter content. While I'd prefer people approach me if they want new content (e.g. adding new lines for classes/races), crossmod is free real estate. You can contact me to co-write / co-code it. Or simply add the crossmod on your end without my involvement.
